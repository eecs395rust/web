## Strings are for text, and text is for humans

[Boolean blind](boolean_blindness) code collapses the information that it needs down to a `bool`, thus requiring additional checks later. By analogy, we could say that code suffering from “text blindness” hides hard-won knowledge in an obscure and difficult to use form—a string.

Here’s what the great 20th century computer scientist Alan Perlis had to say on the matter:

> The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.
