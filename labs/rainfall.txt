rainfall

Reads a sequence of rainfall measurements from the standard input and
writes a summary to the standard output.

INPUT

The input format is a sequence of measurements represented as
unitless, non-negative numbers, written in ASCII, one per line:

    12.5
    18
    7
    0
    4

Any noise in the input---blank lines, non-numeric text, negative
numbers---should be ignored:

    seven
    -9

Input terminates with either end-of-file or upon reaching a line "999".

OUTPUT

The program computes three quantities: the mean (valid) measurement,
the count of measurements in the interval [mean - 5, mean), and the
count of measurements in the interval (mean, mean + 5]. It prints the
results in this format:

    Mean rainfall: 8.3 cm
    Below count:   2
    Above count:   1
