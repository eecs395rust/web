<h2>General information</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Modern, safe programming languages such as Java and Python have
become increasingly accepted for application-level programming, but for
systems programming, which often requires precise, low-level control of
system resources, programmers still turn to C and C++. The new
programming language Rust, under development by Mozilla, promises the
best of both worlds: the type safety of Java with the speed and
expressiveness of C++. Through discussions, lectures, and programming
exercises, students will learn how to program in Rust and to use its
resource ownership model effectively. Rust is especially well suited for
our particular focus, systems programming, so students will use Rust as
a vehicle for exploring both classic systems programming problems and
more contemporary concerns.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
This course assumes proficiency in C++ and some programming maturity.
In particular, we assume you are comfortable with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>pointers;

<h2>Resources</h2>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>There is no required textbook. However, you are likely to find some
online references useful:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming
      Language, 2nd edition</a> (popularly known as “the Rust book”)
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/">The standard library
    reference</a>
</ul>

<p>Please post your questions on our
<a
href="https://campuswire.com/c/GF6C6945F">Campuswire
discussion board</a>.

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>We will use <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html">Rust
1.40.0</a>, the current stable release.
On macOS or Linux, it’s recommended that you install Rust using rustup,
with this single command:

<pre>    <code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh</code></pre>

<p>
Rust is also available on the lab machines (<em>finagle.wot.eecs</em>,
<em>batgirl.eecs</em>, etc.). Add
<code>/home/jesse/pub/rust/cargo/bin</code>
to your <code>PATH</code>.
</p>

<p>
We also will use C++ 2017, the current version of the C++ programming
language; earlier versions of C++ may not work for all the code we
write. The instructor will be using <a
  href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/">CLion</a>, a
cross-platform IDE. CLion ordinarily costs money, but <a
  href="https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students">student licenses are available for free</a>. Any other
conforming C++17 toolchain should work.
</p>

<p>For editing Rust, CLion has a <a
  href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust">good plugin</a>
that your instructor uses. Alternatively, many Rust programmers like <a
  href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft VS Code</a>, which
allegedly has good Rust support via the <a
  href="https://rls.booyaa.wtf/">Rust Language Server</a>.
Theoretically the RLS can provide Rust support to any Language
Server–enabled editor, including Vim and Emacs, though it’s still in
active development and your mileage may vary.</p>

<section id="policies">
<h2>Course policies</h2>

<h3>Collaboration and academic integrity</h3>

<p>You may not collaborate with anyone on any of the exams. You
may not use any electronic tools, including phones, tablets,
netbooks, laptops, desktop computers, etc. If in doubt, ask a
member of the course staff.

<p>Most homework assignments will be completed with a partner or team.
You should work with your official partner or team, as specified, on
homework assignments. You may discuss your work with anyone, but you may
not look at others’ code, and all work you submit must your own, or when
appropriate, your team’s.
The best place to discuss anything related to the course is on our <a
  href="https://campuswire.com/c/GF6C6945F">Campuswire
  discussion board</a>. Of course, you may always ask the instructor for
help; when working with a partner, it’s best to ask for help together.
</p>

<p>Providing illicit help to another student is also cheating, and are
subject to the same penalties as those who receive illicit help. It is
your responsibility to safeguard your own work.

<p>Students who cheat will be reported to the appropriate dean.

<p>If you are unclear on any of these policies, please ask a
member of the course staff.

<h3 id="hwpolicies">Homework</h3>

<p>In general, you should submit your homework according to the
instructions on the web pages for the individual assignments.</p>

<h4>Late work</h4>

<p>
Acceptance of late work is at the discretion of the instructor.
Generally, I would rather have you do the work and learn something
rather than skip it.

<h3>Grades</h3>

<p>
<em>Tentative:</em>
Your grade will be based on your performance on
</p>

<ul>
  <li>class participation (10%),
  <li>four programming assignments (20%),
  <li>two midterm exams (40%), and
  <li>one final project (30%).
</ul>

<p>
The mapping of raw point totals to letter grades is at the
discretion of the instructor.
